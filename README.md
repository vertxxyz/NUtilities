# NUtilities
A collection of various tools and utilities for Unity.

## 🚨 WORK IN PROGRESS 🚨
This is a platform for adding utilities to Unity as I see fit.

[Utilities relating to timeline](https://github.com/vertxxyz/NTimeline) have their own package separate to this.

Other important tools I have made may remain separate to this, like:
- [NTexturePreview](https://github.com/vertxxyz/NTexturePreview) - Enhanced Texture Previewer for Unity
- [NSelection](https://github.com/vertxxyz/NSelection) - Simple selection for busy scenes in Unity

----
## Usage:
See the wiki for explanations of each utility.

## Installation
Edit your `manifest.json` file to contain `"com.vertx.nutilities": "https://github.com/vertxxyz/NUtilities.git",`

To update the package with new changes, remove the lock from the bottom of the `manifest.json` file.
